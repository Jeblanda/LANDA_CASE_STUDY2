        <h2>Why GreenSense is Different</h2>
        
            <div>Many tools for farmers are either too complicated or designed for large industrial operations. Spreadsheet tracking is manual and time-consuming. Traditional farm management software is expensive and often too complex for small-scale growers..</div>
